# SQLAlchemy Challenge


## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

To begin, use Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. All of the following analysis should be completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Precipitation Analysis

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.

* Selected only the `date` and `prcp` values.

* Loaded the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.

* Sorted the DataFrame values by `date`.

* Plotted the results using the DataFrame `plot` method.

* Used Pandas to print the summary statistics for the precipitation data.

### Station Analysis

* Designed a query to calculate the total number of stations.

* Designed a query to find the most active stations.

  * Listed the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Determined which station has the highest number of observations?

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

  * Filtered by the station with the highest number of observations.

  * Plotted the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

* Designed a Flask API based on the queries that were developed.
